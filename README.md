# Vaahteraliiga

A website created with React and Node.js.

I used to play american football here in Finland and still like to follow the sport especially Vaahteraliiga.
So I made this website to follow the current status of the league.

The scores are all manually copied from [Vaahteraliiga's own website](https://tulospalvelu.jenkkifutis.fi/taulukot#season:2,series:26,phase:1,group:60)
